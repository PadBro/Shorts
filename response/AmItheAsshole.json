The whole family on my husbands side as well as her in-law's side will be attending the celebration. So, assuming we will be opening presents with the whole family (because this is what we have done EVERY year and that is what normal families do...). After already buying and preparing the gifts for them to be opened on Christmas Eve...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[Important: My husbands sister' in-law's are doing a Christmas lunch (in which presents will not be given or opened there) and have invited us, and my husbands sister decided to host a Christmas Eve party for the whole family.\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe come to find out today from my husbands father (to note: not even from his sister who is hosting this whole thing) that we will NOT be exchanging gifts for Christmas Eve this year or opening them up with everyone together. Instead, the parents are staying the night and will be opening up gifts on Christmas morning leaving me and my husband alone on Christmas morning while the rest of the family gets to open gifts together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not one to go crazy over receiving gifts but me and my husband are family oriented and love to give gifts. The issue here is the whole point of coming together as a family Christmas or Christmas Eve is to generally open up the gifts we got for each other and show thanks and love. We bought gifts for certain people and we will not get the chance to say you're welcome and see their faces when they open up their present. That is literally a big part of Christmas. \n\nSo I had enough of her, I told her how we felt about this and breaking the families Christmas tradition and how it looks from our end that we are pretty much being left out. This is how the conversation went.\n\nI first sent her 2 messages asking why we aren't opening gifts and she straight up ignores my question and moves onto asking me why I haven't replied to her mother in-law's invitation for Christmas Day Lunch. Me and my husband debated going because we are going to see them on Christmas Eve. \n\nThen she replies that the only gifts she is opening are her in-laws gifts and her step-kid' gifts on CHRISTMAS MORNING.\n\nMe: \"Ok it's just under the impression that if we're all coming together as a family on Christmas eve, we open gifts together as a family. I understand for (her step-daughter) on opening her gifts on Christmas Day but everyone is getting gifts and giving them the day before so why would we not open them in front of everyone and see their reaction and say thanks.\"\n\nSister In-Law: \"Okay, (Me).

The whole family on my husbands side as well as her in-law&amp;#39;s side will be attending the celebration. So, assuming we will be opening presents with the whole family (because this is what we have done EVERY year and that is what normal families do...). After already buying and preparing the gifts for them to be opened on Christmas Eve...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[Important: My husbands sister&amp;#39; in-law&amp;#39;s are doing a Christmas lunch (in which presents will not be given or opened there) and have invited us, and my husbands sister decided to host a Christmas Eve party for the whole family.]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We come to find out today from my husbands father (to note: not even from his sister who is hosting this whole thing) that we will NOT be exchanging gifts for Christmas Eve this year or opening them up with everyone together. Instead, the parents are staying the night and will be opening up gifts on Christmas morning leaving me and my husband alone on Christmas morning while the rest of the family gets to open gifts together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not one to go crazy over receiving gifts but me and my husband are family oriented and love to give gifts. The issue here is the whole point of coming together as a family Christmas or Christmas Eve is to generally open up the gifts we got for each other and show thanks and love. We bought gifts for certain people and we will not get the chance to say you&amp;#39;re welcome and see their faces when they open up their present. That is literally a big part of Christmas. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I had enough of her, I told her how we felt about this and breaking the families Christmas tradition and how it looks from our end that we are pretty much being left out. This is how the conversation went.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I first sent her 2 messages asking why we aren&amp;#39;t opening gifts and she straight up ignores my question and moves onto asking me why I haven&amp;#39;t replied to her mother in-law&amp;#39;s invitation for Christmas Day Lunch. Me and my husband debated going because we are going to see them on Christmas Eve. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then she replies that the only gifts she is opening are her in-laws gifts and her step-kid&amp;#39; gifts on CHRISTMAS MORNING.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Ok it&amp;#39;s just under the impression that if we&amp;#39;re all coming together as a family on Christmas eve, we open gifts together as a family. I understand for (her step-daughter) on opening her gifts on Christmas Day but everyone is getting gifts and giving them the day before so why would we not open them in front of everyone and see their reaction and say thanks.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sister In-Law: &amp;quot;Okay, (Me). Go ahead and bring the gifts you have for everyone and we will exchange.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;No that&amp;#39;s fine, we wont exchange because you seem upset and I wasn&amp;#39;t trying to change anything.

Family was poor, no savings, no property, no opportunities. I started working since 14 and by 17 moved out to another city, with no wish to return. At 19 I started getting a bit more money and sent some home for my siblings. Sometimes B texted me that he is with S alone and M is gone at night, or she is drinking with someone at home and he is afraid. It happened 1-2 times in 2-3 months and scared the shit of me, other times M was sober and worked.\n\nThen shit happened in our country, I was forced to leave. I couldn't bear the thought I'll receive B's texts at night again and would be powerless. Also, it seemed like my mother gained some insights and was finally ready to change her life. So, I offered them to move with me.\n\nPlan was simple - I'll prepare everything, they'll come to see if it's good country to stay. If yes - I'm moving to another flat with my husband. I'll pay for flat, utilities + fixed sum for groceries, other money M should earn herself.\n\nLots of things went wrong. I'm being the breadwinner for 2 years now. It's still enough money for us all to live cheap, but not enough for another flat or savings. M found the profession she likes and I'm happy for her, even if she still struggle with finances.\n\nToday we argued about B's study plans. He wants to go abroad, it seems like good opportunity, so I'm going to finance it. But M said she would not let him go. She had a dream where he died alone, so she'll not allow it. I answered that I'm not going to fund any remote tuition and reminded her that when she didn't allow me to leave I simply ran out from home. She exploded, told B he's a fool to believe me cause I only care about ambitions and money over his life, and that I should buy them tickets home right after the new year.\n\nIt's not the first time. I never told her about B's texts and neither did he, but she knows I don't want siblings to leave.\n\nI'm tired of her, her comments about my husband not being 'man' enough, me being mercantile. I want to buy her a one way ticket and go NC forever. I started hardening my heart against her years ago, and now I'm 70% sure her words can't cut me deep.\n\nBut there are my siblings. She's already telling my S, who was too little when I left to know me, that I want them gone on the sly. And S started to be shy and afraid of me. B will be guilt tripped to staying and helping with S or working to bring some money. I don't know if he'll be able to continue his preparation for uni in such conditions.\n\nAITA and did everything wrong? Right now my go-to plan is to ignore M, help B be more independent and be kind with S, while looking for a higher paid job. Then I'll be able to move out, but still manage to provide two households for some time, even if they'll leave because of  argue", "author_fullname": "t2_7s2mx8zt6", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "AITA for blackmailing mom with brother's future", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AmItheAsshole", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_18ply6m", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "restricted", "ups": 26, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "TL;DR", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 26, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": 1703492798.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1703386902.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.AmItheAsshole", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;re 5 of us living together - me and my husband (both 25), my mother (&amp;#39;M&amp;#39;,50), brother (&amp;#39;B&amp;#39;,16) and sister(&amp;#39;S&amp;#39;,8).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always had tough relationships with M ( &amp;quot;disrespectful daughter&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;witch-prophet-mother&amp;quot;).

I couldn&amp;#39;t bear the thought I&amp;#39;ll receive B&amp;#39;s texts at night again and would be powerless. Also, it seemed like my mother gained some insights and was finally ready to change her life. So, I offered them to move with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plan was simple - I&amp;#39;ll prepare everything, they&amp;#39;ll come to see if it&amp;#39;s good country to stay. If yes - I&amp;#39;m moving to another flat with my husband. I&amp;#39;ll pay for flat, utilities + fixed sum for groceries, other money M should earn herself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lots of things went wrong. I&amp;#39;m being the breadwinner for 2 years now. It&amp;#39;s still enough money for us all to live cheap, but not enough for another flat or savings. M found the profession she likes and I&amp;#39;m happy for her, even if she still struggle with finances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today we argued about B&amp;#39;s study plans. He wants to go abroad, it seems like good opportunity, so I&amp;#39;m going to finance it. But M said she would not let him go. She had a dream where he died alone, so she&amp;#39;ll not allow it. I answered that I&amp;#39;m not going to fund any remote tuition and reminded her that when she didn&amp;#39;t allow me to leave I simply ran out from home. She exploded, told B he&amp;#39;s a fool to believe me cause I only care about ambitions and money over his life, and that I should buy them tickets home right after the new year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not the first time. I never told her about B&amp;#39;s texts and neither did he, but she knows I don&amp;#39;t want siblings to leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m tired of her, her comments about my husband not being &amp;#39;man&amp;#39; enough, me being mercantile. I want to buy her a one way ticket and go NC forever. I started hardening my heart against her years ago, and now I&amp;#39;m 70% sure her words can&amp;#39;t cut me deep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there are my siblings. She&amp;#39;s already telling my S, who was too little when I left to know me, that I want them gone on the sly. And S started to be shy and afraid of me. B will be guilt tripped to staying and helping with S or working to bring some money. I don&amp;#39;t know if he&amp;#39;ll be able to continue his preparation for uni in such conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AITA and did everything wrong? Right now my go-to plan is to ignore M, help B be more independent and be kind with S, while looking for a higher paid job. Then I&amp;#39;ll be able to move out, but still manage to provide two households for some time, even if they&amp;#39;ll leave because of  argue&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "ebec91c6-d244-11e8-8071-0e5106890194", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2xhvq", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#d3d6da", "id": "18ply6m", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "InvestmentOk9388", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ply6m/aita_for_blackmailing_mom_with_brothers_future/", "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ply6m/aita_for_blackmailing_mom_with_brothers_future/", "subreddit_subscribers": 12982972, "created_utc": 1703386902.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "AmItheAsshole", "selftext": "Last year I spent Thanksgiving with his extended family and he spent Christmas with mine.
